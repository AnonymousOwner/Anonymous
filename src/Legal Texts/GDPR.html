<li>the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/">Article 21</a>(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/">Article 21</a>(2);</li>

<li>Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:
<ol>
<li>for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
<li>for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;</li>
<li>for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/">Article 9</a>(2) as well as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/">Article 9</a>(3);</li>
<li>for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/">Article 89</a>(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or</li>
<li>for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
